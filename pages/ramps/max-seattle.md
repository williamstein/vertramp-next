# Max Hohlbein's mini vert ramp in Seattle

I don't know what the specs are or even when the
status of this ramp is. I skated it once when
it was in Capitol Hill outside, before it got moved
to an indoor location somewhere...

It's a small and tight ramp, like we used to build in the '80s,
and which a lot of the Seattle area rippers love.
