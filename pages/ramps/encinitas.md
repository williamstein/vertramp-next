# The Encinitas YMCA Vert ramp

This used to be an old huge wide curved X-Games vert ramp.  It
got chopped in half to make room for new things.  The other half
is now [Mancha's ramp](/ramps/mancha.md).

Specs: I don't know.  It's at least 13.5' tall, and definitely has at
least 2' of vert.  


I've skated the new and old versions of this ramp many times.  
I was even in a serious pro demo here once.  I had planned to watch
the demo, but not very many pro skaters showed up, and 
I can do handplants, which is enough to make spectators happy.
Here's a session I video'd in 2012, when the ramp was full size.  The sessions back then were awesome!
