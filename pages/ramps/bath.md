# The Bath Vert Ramp in Victoria Park

Specs: steel, 10' high, 9.5' transitions (?); totally free.

I skated here once in I think early 2012, while attending
a mathematics conference in nearby Bristol.  I was skating
with the locals and doing backside bonelesses on the ramp,
and amazingly one of the local vert skaters said "heh, the
way you do that looks familiar", and it turns out we had
skated together a few months earlier in Seattle!

## What Happened to it?
I don't know if this ramp still exists somewhere.  I did find a[petition to keep the ramps ](https://www.change.org/p/keep-the-ramps-bath-skatepark)from 7 years ago, but the following video seems to show a beautiful new
vert bowl right where the vert ramp was:
