# Elliot Sloan's Rockstar Ramp

Elliot Sloan has a huge vert ramp in his backyard, along
with a megaramp complex.  It's one of the most epic things
to skate in SoCal.

I've skated it a few times, and it's well over 100 feet wide,
and significant parts are over 14' tall.  However, I don't
know the specs.  Here's a video of me skating the vert ramp in 2014:

[Ryan Spence](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-spence-1908211a5) did
significant design work on Sloan's megaramp.  (But who built it?  What are
the specs?)
