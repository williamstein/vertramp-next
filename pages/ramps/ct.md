# CT bike and indoor skatepark - world's oldest indoor vert ramp

[CT bike and indoor skatepark](http://ctbike.com/) in Bristol, Connecticut
has the world's oldest indoor skatepark and vert ramp.
It was built in 1987 and is still skated, over 3 decades
later!

Specs: 24’ wide, 9 1/2 - 10’ tall, 16’ flat, 9’ transitions.

The people who own the park are getting up in age and I'm
not sure how this place can be revamped and preserved for the
future.
