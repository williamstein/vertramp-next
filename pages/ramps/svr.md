# Seattle Vert Ramp

<img src="../../public/images/svr-pano.jpg"   width="584px"  height="188px" />

Seattle Vert Ramp (SVR) is our ramp pictured above, which we built in 2012.

SVR is 56' wide, 13.5' tall with 2' vert.  It also has two 8' wide 15.5' extensions (for 4' of vert).  It's surface consists of four layers of plywood and 1 layer of [Skatelite](https://www.skatelite.com/) laid diagonally at an angle with all edges rounded.   It's covered with a 15,000 pound [ClearSpan](https://www.clearspan.com/) roof, which is set directly on top of the ramp itself.

The ramp was designed and construction led by [Ryan Spence](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-spence-1908211a5) who 
also built [his ramps in Tacoma](/ramps/ryan/).

I did 43 tricks at SVR on my 43rd birthday...
