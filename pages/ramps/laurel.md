## The Ramp

There ~~is~~ was a public vert ramp at the [Laurel skatepark](https://henrico.us/rec/places/laurel/) outside ofRichmond VA in Henrico County. It was built in 1990.

Specs: It’s 10’ high by 32’ wide with a 6” extension on one side.  Jeremy reports

> "I believe the specs are 8 1/2’ transition with 18” vert, because it's about a board's wheelbase of vertical."
