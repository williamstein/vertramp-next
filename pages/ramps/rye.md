Specs: nearly exact replica of what you would find on the Dew Tour - 60′ wide, 12′ tranny, 2′ of vert, 22′ tall x 5′ wide roll-ins on either end
of one side, Skatelite Pro surface.

I visited here once in 2012, and it was a dream to skate:

I ended up skating the vert ramp with 
Nora Vasconcellos and Nolan Munroe, which was pretty cool.

Here's some more video of this amazing vert ramp:

## 2022 UPDATE (from Ryan Taylor)

> "Hey there, 
 
> Great to stumble upon your ramp list. like that you keep it up to date. I took apart the Rye Vert Ramp and moved it over to Buffalo, New York. It got set up in a key holder warehouse as an 11 1/2'; original transitions were kept underneath the current ramp. Original rye ramp was a 14'ft 1in H ramp. Measured with a laser from tip of coping to top of skatelite. 14 ft of flat 2 ft of vert I believe at 12 ft radius. There were rumors of an elliptical via Jason Speer's ramp building madness. 

> The ramp I did not see on your list is an odd one. Tucked away in Ludlow Vermont right near Okemo resort. It appears to be 9 to 9 and 1/2 ft somewhere around there. It's not quite six sheets wide so it's around 22 to 24 ft wide. What is odd is that it's pool coping on one side, and standard coping on the other. They redid a bunch of back railings and decks on the vert ramp as well as the bowl but never redid the coping, underlayment, or surfacing. The ramp is unskateble due to how dilapidated it is. All the New England vert guys wrote it off as non-existent. Many screws are poking up and won't go back in no matter what angle you stick it back in the hole. The underlayment is that bad, also surfaced in sheet metal which shows how much of a loss it was from the get-go.

> The only place for sessionable vert is the 11 and 1/2 deep end of the Lynch family pro bowl. Surface isn't very smooth for knee slides and pants, but the graffiti helps.

> I'm looking at putting a ramp up in the Boston area as soon as possible. We have funds put together and are just searching for a location. I run New England's only insured skatepark company called Eastern Ramps.  Appreciate your list -- keep killing it with that!"

## 2021 UPDATE (by Joe)

-- unfortunately,  Rye Airfeld is now closed as our man Joe in the field reports

> "So sad. Was supposed to skate this vert ramp first time ever. I arrived, but thanks to covid, the ramp was down to the sheathing being disassembled and moved to Buffalo. Rye closed too.  How is it the best park in the northeast closed? Save VERT!!! The closest ramp is [in Connecticut](/ramps/ct). Why!? Just WHY!?!?!?   I met the guy who bought the ramp, super awesome dude. They're rebuilding it somewhere in Buffalo sometime in the future."
