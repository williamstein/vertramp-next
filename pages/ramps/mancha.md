# The Bteam Ramp: Evando Mancha's vert ramp

The Encinitas YMCA used to have a huge old X-games vert ramp.
They chopped it in half to make room for a bunch of smaller 
concrete features, and this is the half that left.

I've skated it a few times, and every session was **awesome**.  Here
is me doing my best [Paul-luc Ronchetti](https://www.instagram.com/plronchetti/?hl=en) impersonation while rocking my Seattle Vert Ramp shirt (the real PLR is standing right behind me):

Here's me and Ryan Hass after a session; this picture gives a good
sense of the scale of the ramp.  It's terrifying to climb a ladder to
get up the pictured side of the ramp, whereas the other side has a nice 
staircase.
