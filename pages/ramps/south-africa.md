Status? The official website for the ramp was at https://WWW.VERT.CO.ZA, but
it has vanished, since the ramp recently **moved** to Halfway Gardens. Here's the new 2021 [website](https://the-vert-ramp.business.site/)  for the ramp and a [PDF with schematics](/extra/south-africa.pdf) for the new ramp.
